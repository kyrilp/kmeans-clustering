# Kmeans Implementation Report

This report covers techniques to model data sets where the labels are not provided (unsupervised). I focus on explaining and implementing the kmeans algorithm and mention a few other methods for different types of data sets.

Please view the 'kmeans.ipynb' or 'kmeans.pdf' for the full report.
