# Kmeans Clustering

This report covers techniques to model data sets when the target labels are not provided (unsupervised). I focus on explaining and implementing the kmeans algorithm and mention a few other methods for different types of unsupervised data sets.

Please view the 'kmeans.ipynb' or 'kmeans.pdf' for the full report. For kmeans implementation, please view 'kmeans.py'.
